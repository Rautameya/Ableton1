        Making music isn't easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when
        you're in the flow, it's incredibly rewarding.
      </h1>
      <p>
        We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force
        behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make
        it for.

        We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between
        our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use
        Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
        professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
        and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared
        belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to
        something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

          <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
            people what they need to work their magic and grow. We've learned that
            achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
            diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
            perspectives. We don't always agree with each other, but opinion and
            debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>
